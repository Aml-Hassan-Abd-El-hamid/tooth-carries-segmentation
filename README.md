# Tooth Carries Segmentation

## What's this repo about:

This was a job interview task, that was the task statement
```
we are going to send you an image segmentation task,
so you can apply carries detection on the attached files,
so we got a pounding box for the caries on each tooth.
```
I was provided with exactly 6 images, 3 were teeth with no pounding boxes and 3 with pounding boxes.

## How I did the task:

Given the amount of data that I was provided with, the lack of time and resources to collect more data, and the lack of proper computational power, the first method that encountered my mind to finish such a task was to use a strong model that's already trained and ready to go.<br>
I chose to go with **Yolov8** given the fact that I already used it in similar tasks before and it's also open source and easy for use and setup.<br>
